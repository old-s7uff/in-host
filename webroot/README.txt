						INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
===================================================================

1. Unzip the contents of the .zip file to a folder on your computer.

3. Upload the entire contents of the folder '/upload_me' to your website in binary mode. It is recommended to change the name of the '/admin' folder.

4. CHMOD file '/.ssh/passphrase' to 0777.

5. Make the '/ajxp/data/' folder writeable by the server
	|-> For example:
		"chown -R www-data /ajxp/data/"
		"chmod -R 0777 /ajxp/data/"

6. Run the installation script at http://www.yourdomain.com/install/index.php

7. Once complete, delete the install folder from your web server.

	|-> Filename syntax: 'README-version-UPDATE.txt'

1. Remove all files (including the configuration.php file) from your website, both client and admin sides.

	- DO NOT FORGET TO UPLOAD '.version' FOLDER IN ORDER TO OVERWRITE THE FILE '/.version/version.xml' !

6. CHMOD file '/.ssh/passphrase' to 0777.

7. Make the '/ajxp/data/' folder writeable by the server
